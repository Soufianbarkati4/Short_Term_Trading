*Project Overview :*

This project aims to build a predictive model using the XGBoost algorithm. It leverages various Python libraries, including yfinance for data retrieval, to analyze historical data and make predictions based on the selected features. The XGBoost model is well-suited for this task, given its robust performance with structured data.

*Project Structure :*

  - Data Collection: Uses yfinance to fetch historical financial data, which is then processed for modeling.
    
  - Feature Engineering: Creates features relevant to the prediction task, likely including technical indicators and transformations of the raw data.
    
  - Model Training: Implements and trains an XGBoost model, optimized for accuracy.
    
  - Evaluation: Assesses model performance on a test set to ensure reliable predictions.

*Results :*

The notebook provides model evaluation metrics, demonstrating the XGBoost model's ability to make accurate predictions based on historical data. These results offer insights into the model's application potential for similar datasets.
